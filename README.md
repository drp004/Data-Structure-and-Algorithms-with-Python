# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-with-Python
 
This repository contains Python implementations of popular data structures and algorithms. The goal is to provide a reference for learners and practitioners of DSA.

The following data structures are covered:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Tries

The repository also includes implementations of key algorithms, including:

- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Prim's, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
